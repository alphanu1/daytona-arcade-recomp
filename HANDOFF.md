# Handoff

## Current state

Design only, now with the Target hardware summary confirmed against MAME.
No code, tooling or build yet.

## Complete

- Design document.
- Project rules (`rules.md`) and `.gitignore`.
- M0 step 1: "from memory" figures checked against MAME `sega/model2.cpp` at
  `dddd73680656e355bb2b5beecab1167c9f07bf81` and the Model 2 MiSTer core at
  `591e148e87d27e03d50cbf7318bf0b1d1328c4bf`. Design doc corrected in place
  (Target hardware summary, TGP HLE, Floating point, Audio, Open questions).

## Next, in order

M0 tooling (design doc, Milestones):

1. MAME trace plugin, input recorder, trace diff tool, i960 disassembler.
   The first trace should also capture Daytona's PRCB (ICR / interrupt table)
   to fix the real IRQ priority order, and whether it ever writes
   `geo_prg_w` (0x00804000).
2. Decide the FP oracle question (Open decisions) before the unit-test tier
   is written, since it sets what "matches MAME" means for FP opcodes.

## Open decisions

- Project licence. The Model 2 MiSTer core is GPL-3; lifting from it decides
  this.
- FP oracle. MAME's i960 FP is host `double`, not 80-bit. Options: diff in a
  MAME-compatible `double` mode, or patch the trace MAME to use extF80.
- `addc` carry. MAME never sets it. Recompile to the silicon and flag the diff
  when it fires (the MiSTer core made the same call, its study §2.3).

## Findings

Confirmed from MAME `model2.cpp` (all MAME figures, not PCB measurements):

| Item | Was (from memory) | MAME |
| --- | --- | --- |
| i960KB clock | ~25 MHz | 25 MHz (`50_MHz_XTAL / 2`) |
| TGP | MB86234 + microcode ROM | one MB86234 at 50 MHz; program uploaded by the i960, 2,024 words from the data ROM; run LLE |
| Resolution | ~496x384 | 496x384 active, 656x424 total, 16 MHz pixel clock |
| Refresh | ~57.5 Hz | 57.524 Hz; line rate 24.39 kHz (MAME: "TODO: from System 24") |
| Sound | 68000 + 2x SCSP, ~11 MHz | **Model 1 sound board**: 68000 @ 10 MHz + YM3438 + 2x MultiPCM |
| Main to sound | command latch | i8251 UART at 31.25 kbit/s; IRQ3 handler is the transmit loop |
| I/O | direct ADCs | Model 1 I/O board, own Z80 @ 4 MHz, via MB8421 dual-port RAM |
| IRQ order | unknown | bit 0 vblank -> IRQ0, bits 2-5 timers -> IRQ2, bit 10 UART -> IRQ3; priority set by the game's ICR (`vector / 8`) |

Also found:

- A separate geometrizer (0x00800000 / 0x00804000) walks the display list in
  buffer RAM at vblank. It is not the TGP. MAME's is HLE in host `float`.
- The SCSP figures in the MiSTer core's design study are for 2A-CRX in general;
  its README confirms Daytona's working sound is 68000 + FM + MultiPCM. Both
  sources agree with MAME.
- MAME `subc` carry was fixed upstream since MAME 0.289; `addc` was not
  (operands still `uint32_t` before widening, `i960.cpp` ~line 1359).
- The design doc's "15 kHz capture" was wrong for this timing; changed to
  24 kHz medium resolution, pending PCB confirmation.

## What not to re-propose

- SCSP for Daytona. It is the Model 1 sound board (MAME `model2o` config and
  the MiSTer core's working sound on hardware).
- Five TGPs. One device; "5x" was a board-level package count.
- A TGP microcode ROM dump. The program is uploaded at boot from the game's
  data ROM; dump TGP program RAM only after the upload, or it is zeros.
