# Handoff

## Current state

M0 tooling runs against real MAME with the real game (`daytona93`, user's ROM
set, git-ignored `roms/` in this cloud container, never committed). Model-2-only
MAME with the harvest patch builds here (`scripts/build_mame.sh`, ~50 min cold,
15 s incremental); `scripts/run_trace.sh` runs it headless.
Built and tested here: i960 decoder + `i960dis`, trace library + `tracediff`,
and the MAME plugin `tools/mame-plugins/m2trace` (trace recorder, input
recorder/replayer). The plugin is tested only against a mock of MAME's Lua API.

Build: `scripts/fetch_mame.sh` (optional, for the oracle test), then
`cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja && ninja -C build && ctest --test-dir build`.
The Lua tests need `pip install lupa` (Lua 5.4) and skip without it.

Running the plugin (user's machine, with their ROM set):

    M2TRACE_OUT=traces/attract.m2tr M2TRACE_FRAMES=600 \
    mame daytona -plugin m2trace -pluginspath "<mame>/plugins;<repo>/tools/mame-plugins"

`M2TRACE_RECORD_INPUT` / `M2TRACE_REPLAY_INPUT` record and replay inputs;
`docs/trace-format.md` has the rest.

## Complete

- Design document.
- Project rules (`rules.md`) and `.gitignore`.
- M0 step 1: "from memory" figures checked against MAME `sega/model2.cpp` at
  `dddd73680656e355bb2b5beecab1167c9f07bf81` and the Model 2 MiSTer core at
  `591e148e87d27e03d50cbf7318bf0b1d1328c4bf`. Design doc corrected in place
  (Target hardware summary, TGP HLE, Floating point, Audio, Open questions).
- M0 i960 disassembler: `src/i960` (decoder + MAME-syntax formatter),
  `tools/i960dis` (linear sweep; `--interleave` joins the ROM_LOAD32_WORD pair),
  `tests/test_decode` (66 hand-encoded checks), `tests/mame_oracle`
  (differential against MAME's own `i960dis.cpp`, compiled unmodified).
- `src/i960/reach` (recursive descent + boot-record seeds), `i960dis --follow`,
  `tests/test_reach` (19 checks).
- M0 trace format, `tracediff`, MAME plugin and input recorder
  (`docs/trace-format.md`, `src/trace`, `tools/tracediff`,
  `tools/mame-plugins/m2trace`), with `tests/test_trace` (30 checks),
  `tests/lua_core_test.py` (19) and `tests/lua_plugin_mock_test.py` (17).

## Next, in order

M0 tooling (design doc, Milestones):

1. Harvest the 21 indirect sites no run has hit (47 of 68 so far). Two
   scripted screens do not respond as expected (see Findings): circuit
   select ignores scripted steering, and test-mode red presses land one item
   short (SOUND TEST instead of TGP TEST). Best settled by the user playing
   once with M2TRACE_RECORD_INPUT on their PC and sharing the .m2in (inputs
   only, no game data), then replaying it here.
2. M0 exit review against the design doc, then M1 (boot) per the milestone
   order.
3. Ghidra SLEIGH cross-check: blocked. Mainline Ghidra has no i960 module;
   needs the user to choose a third-party one (Open decisions).
4. Decide the FP oracle question (Open decisions) before the unit-test tier
   is written, since it sets what "matches MAME" means for FP opcodes.

## Open decisions

- Project licence. The Model 2 MiSTer core is GPL-3; lifting from it decides
  this.
- Ghidra i960 module: mainline has none. Which third-party module, and its
  licence, is the user's call.
- FP oracle. MAME's i960 FP is host `double`, not 80-bit. Options: diff in a
  MAME-compatible `double` mode, or patch the trace MAME to use extF80.
- `addc` carry. MAME never sets it. Recompile to the silicon and flag the diff
  when it fires (the MiSTer core made the same call, its study §2.3).

## Findings

Confirmed from MAME `model2.cpp` (all MAME figures, not PCB measurements):

| Item | Was (from memory) | MAME |
| --- | --- | --- |
| i960KB clock | ~25 MHz | 25 MHz (`50_MHz_XTAL / 2`) |
| TGP | MB86234 + microcode ROM | one MB86234 at 50 MHz; program uploaded by the i960, 2,024 words from the data ROM; run LLE |
| Resolution | ~496x384 | 496x384 active, 656x424 total, 16 MHz pixel clock |
| Refresh | ~57.5 Hz | 57.524 Hz; line rate 24.39 kHz (MAME: "TODO: from System 24") |
| Sound | 68000 + 2x SCSP, ~11 MHz | **Model 1 sound board**: 68000 @ 10 MHz + YM3438 + 2x MultiPCM |
| Main to sound | command latch | i8251 UART at 31.25 kbit/s; IRQ3 handler is the transmit loop |
| I/O | direct ADCs | Model 1 I/O board, own Z80 @ 4 MHz, via MB8421 dual-port RAM |
| IRQ order | unknown | bit 0 vblank -> IRQ0, bits 2-5 timers -> IRQ2, bit 10 UART -> IRQ3; ICR 0f0e0d0c (measured): all priority 1 |

i960 decoder (MAME `i960.cpp` / `i960dis.cpp` at `dddd7368`):

- MAME's executor implements 62 non-REG and 102 REG opcodes; its disassembler
  knows many more (whole-family table). The recompiler accepts only the
  executor's set.
- Executor and disassembler disagree on three encodings; decoder follows the
  executor and flags them: CTRL/COBR bits 1:0 (executor adds them to the
  target), MEMB bits 6:5 (executor ignores), MEMB scale > 4 (executor shifts).
- MAME's disassembler table has `ldtime` at 0x671, shadowed by `ediv`; it can
  never print. `movre` appears at 0x6e1 (undocumented, executed) and 0x6e9.
- Differential test, random + every opcode byte x 65,536 tails: 71,108,864
  words, 0 mismatches, 8.0 s on 4 threads (this container). Mutation check:
  three deliberate faults (MEMB scale bound, COBR displacement mask, one REG
  mnemonic) gave 79,619 / 2,220,826 / 9,837 mismatches, so the test can fail.
- Exhaustive run, `mame_oracle --exhaustive`: all 4,294,967,296 first words
  (second word random per word), 0 mismatches, 596 s on 4 threads (this
  container). Text and reported length both compared.

Trace tooling:

- Every signal the design doc asks for except indirect branch targets is
  reachable from MAME's Lua API alone (write/read taps, `read_range`,
  `state[]`), so the plugin needs no MAME patch yet.
- MAME's end-of-frame notifier is not on a guest instruction boundary, so it
  cannot be a lockstep sample point; the default is the vblank-ack store.
  Unverified for Daytona until the first trace.
- Mock-driven plugin test: record -> replay reproduces the trace exactly; a
  replay value applied one frame late is caught at the right frame; a memory
  change is reported as a region hash at the right epoch.
- The Lua encoder and the C++ writer produce byte-identical traces for the
  same content; the Lua hash equals an independent Python FNV over 8 sizes
  either side of the 1 KiB unpack block.
- Hashing reads 1.4 MiB per sample in Lua; cost unmeasured until a real run.
  If it is too slow, hash fewer regions per sample, not a weaker hash.

First real MAME runs (`daytona93`, MAME `dddd7368` + harvest patch, 600
frames of attract, headless, empty NVRAM each run):

- Plugin loads and every tap fires: 3,567,333 events in 600 frames. 68 s per
  run with tracing on this container (MAME reports 14.9% speed).
- Found and fixed: `screen.frame_number` is a method at this MAME, not the
  property the Lua reference documents; and MAME silently drops errors raised
  in tap callbacks, so the first run had 0 samples and no message. Samples are
  now pcall-wrapped and failures reported.
- **MAME is deterministic for Daytona**: two independent runs gave
  byte-identical traces (60,942,182 bytes, 1,154 epochs, 3,567,333 events)
  and identical branch harvests.
- vblank-ack sampling works, but the handler writes the ack (`fffffffe`) twice
  back to back: steady state is exactly 2 samples per frame, the second epoch
  holding only the second ack. Deterministic, so lockstep is fine; every other
  sample is redundant (cost, not correctness).
- ICR = `0f0e0d0c`, set once (synmov at 0x00000a40): IRQ0-3 -> vectors
  0x0c-0x0f, **all priority 1**. Taken in attract: vector 0x0c (vblank) 576x,
  handler 0x0e00; vector 0x0f (sound UART) 51x, handler 0x0f50. Timers
  (IRQ2) never fire; final enable mask = vblank only.
- Geometrizer program port (0x00804000) **is** written: 411,757 writes, from
  epoch 89. TGP FIFO: 773,279 writes, 697,078 reads.
- Harvest: 16 `bx` sites / 49 targets, 2 `callx` sites / 56 targets; no
  `balx`, no `calls`.
- Static reach with the 107 harvested targets as seeds: 89 -> 13,081
  instructions, 0 stops on non-executable opcodes, **0 quirk encodings in
  reachable code**, 31 indirect sites (18 exercised by attract).

Scripted gameplay in real MAME (`scripts/inputs/race_basic.txt`: 3 coins,
start, confirm selects, hold accelerator; 6,000 frames, no steering):

- Replay self-check passes in real MAME: "replay matched the recording for
  5997 frames", in two independent runs; the two branch harvests are identical.
- First attempt stayed in attract: default settings take 3 coins per credit
  (screen showed CREDIT 1/3). With 3 coins, snapshots show car select, then
  the Beginner course, lap 2 of 8 by frame 6,000.
- Full run 103 s emulated at ~14.5% speed, with or without tracing (MAME's
  software 3D dominates; the Lua taps cost ~nothing).
- Race harvest: 20 bx sites / 53 targets, 6 callx sites / 113 targets.
  Interrupts over 6,000 frames: vblank 5,975, sound UART 4,820, timers never.
- Attract + race seeds (168): static reach 21,850 instructions (attract alone
  13,081), 26 of 35 static indirect sites exercised, still 0 non-executable
  opcodes and 0 quirk encodings reached.

Harvest over 15 scripted runs (attract, races, manual gearbox, time attack,
test mode; all replays self-checked "matched"):

| runs | merged seeds | static reach | indirect sites hit / found |
| attract | 107 | 13,081 | 18 / 31 |
| + race | 168 | 21,850 | 26 / 35 |
| + manual, time attack, test mode | 319 | 23,138 | 46 / 67 |
| + round 3 | 333 | 23,258 | 47 / 68 |

- Still 0 non-executable opcodes and 0 quirk encodings in reachable code.
- Reached and confirmed by snapshot: Beginner race (auto and manual with
  shifting), time attack (start + accelerator at car select), test mode menu
  and sound test.
- Not reached: Advanced/Expert courses (circuit select stays on Beginner with
  steering pulses held 30 frames at 0xe0 from frame 1560 and from 1450), TGP
  and memory test items (7 red presses from frame 1500 land on SOUND TEST
  twice, deterministically). Cause unknown; not guessed further.
- Circuit and car select confirm on an accelerator press ("step to choose");
  holding the accelerator from the start picks the defaults.

Real program image (`daytona93`, epr-16530a/16531a, counts only):

- Linear sweep of the 256 KiB image: 55,098 lines, 16,280 undecodable words,
  7,356 flagged quirks, 759 non-executable opcodes. Mostly data decoded as
  code; not meaningful as code statistics.
- Recursive descent from the boot record (`i960dis --follow`, with the
  0x00220000 mirror): reset IP 0x860, 0 interrupt handlers (the PRCB's table
  is in RAM), 4 system procedures; 89 reachable instructions, 1 indirect site,
  0 quirks. The reset path ends in `b .` idle loops. Static analysis cannot
  get past boot without harvested targets.
- Mainline Ghidra (commit `8e9a8e7a`) has no i960 processor module; nor does
  pypcode. The design doc assumed one.

Also found:

- A separate geometrizer (0x00800000 / 0x00804000) walks the display list in
  buffer RAM at vblank. It is not the TGP. MAME's is HLE in host `float`.
- The SCSP figures in the MiSTer core's design study are for 2A-CRX in general;
  its README confirms Daytona's working sound is 68000 + FM + MultiPCM. Both
  sources agree with MAME.
- MAME `subc` carry was fixed upstream since MAME 0.289; `addc` was not
  (operands still `uint32_t` before widening, `i960.cpp` ~line 1359).
- The design doc's "15 kHz capture" was wrong for this timing; changed to
  24 kHz medium resolution, pending PCB confirmation.

## What not to re-propose

- SCSP for Daytona. It is the Model 1 sound board (MAME `model2o` config and
  the MiSTer core's working sound on hardware).
- Five TGPs. One device; "5x" was a board-level package count.
- MAME's frame notifier as the lockstep sample point (see Trace tooling).
- Using MAME's disassembler as the decode authority. It is the text oracle
  only; semantics come from the executor.
- A TGP microcode ROM dump. The program is uploaded at boot from the game's
  data ROM; dump TGP program RAM only after the upload, or it is zeros.
